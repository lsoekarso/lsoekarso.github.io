The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself:</p> 
<p><i>'How the old woman is snoring! I must just see if she wants anything.'</i> So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it.</p>

<p><i>'Do I find you here, you old sinner!'</i> said he. <i>'I have long sought you!'</i></p> 
<p>But just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf.</p>
