The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.

<p><i>'Good day, Little Red Riding Hood,'</i> said he.</p>

<p><i>'Thank you kindly, wolf.'</i></p>

<p><i>'Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?'</i></p>

<p><i>'To my grandmother's.'</i></p>

<p><i> 'What have you got in your apron?'</i></p>

<p><i>'Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.'</i></p>

<p><i> 'Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?'</i></p>

<p><i> 'A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must know it,'</i> replied Little Red Riding Hood.</p>
