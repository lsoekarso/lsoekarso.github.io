The wolf thought to himself:</p> 

<p><i>'What a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful - she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both.'</i></p>

<p>So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood, and then he said:</p> 
<p><i>'See, Little Red Riding Hood, how pretty the flowers are about here - why do you not look round? I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.'</i></p>
