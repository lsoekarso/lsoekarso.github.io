It is also related that once, when Red Riding Hood was again taking cakes to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path. Red Riding Hood, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said <i>'good morning'</i> to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up.</p>
