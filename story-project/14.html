<i>'Well,'</i> said the grandmother, <i>'we will shut the door, so that he can not come in.'</i></p>

<p>Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried: <i>'Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red Riding Hood, and am bringing you some cakes.'</i></p>

<p>But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until Red Riding Hood went home in the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts.</p>
